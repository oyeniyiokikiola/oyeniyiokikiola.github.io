### Project Title One
*Sales Performance Analysis to Identify Revenue Growth Opportunities Across Regions and Customer Segments

Business Problem / Objective
A retail business needs clarity on revenue performance across products, regions, and customer groups.

Leadership wants answers to:
	•	Why is revenue uneven across regions?
	•	Which products drive the highest sales?
	•	Which customer segments contribute the most revenue?
	•	How did 2024 perform compared to 2023?
The objective was to identify growth drivers and highlight underperforming areas to guide strategic decisions.

Data Preparation
	•	Created a structured date table
	•	Extracted year and month name
	•	Derived weekday and weekend classification
	•	Extracted day name for daily analysis
	•	Built relationships between Sales, Products, Customers and the derived date table
	•	Created measures in Excel
	•	Applied custom number formatting for thousands and millions
	•	Calculated year over year percentage change

Key Questions & Analysis
	•	What is the year over year growth rate?
	•	How does revenue trend monthly?
	•	Which products generate the highest revenue?
	•	Which region generates the highest revenue?
	•	Which age group drives the most sales?

Key Insights
	•	Revenue increased from $6.77M in 2023 to $7.76M in 2024, reflecting 14.58% growth.
	•	71% of total revenue comes from weekdays, indicating stronger business day performance.
	•	The West and East regions each generated about $5M, while North generated only $806K.
	•	Sports category led revenue with $3.1M.
	•	Customers aged 19 to 56 contributed the majority of total revenue at $12M combined.
	•	Female customers accounted for 65% of revenue.
	•	The top product generated $434K, showing revenue concentration among specific items.
These findings highlight clear revenue drivers and regional imbalance.

Recommendations
	•	Investigate operational or market barriers in the North region.
	•	Expand marketing efforts in high performing categories such as Sports.
	•	Develop targeted campaigns for customers aged 19 to 56.
	•	Launch weekend promotions to increase non weekday revenue.
	•	Implement retention strategies for high value customers.


Conclusion
This analysis identified a 14.58% revenue increase year over year and revealed strong dependence on weekday sales and working age customers.
It exposed regional imbalance and product concentration, giving leadership clear direction for targeted revenue growth.
